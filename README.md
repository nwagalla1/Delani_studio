# DELANI_STUDIO

## A touch by Wagalla Nixon

Welcome!!

Delani_Studio is more of a phantom. It is a fictional website meant to enhance skills in Bootstrap, Javascript and JQuery. The Website has been built and created with ultimate care, but, as always, man is to error. Some parts of the website may appear lightly touched but just enjoy viewing and studying the site.
